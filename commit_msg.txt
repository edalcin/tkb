refactor: Convert project to single-container architecture

- Replaced docker-compose with a single root Dockerfile.
- Introduced Supervisor for internal process management (backend, hardhat, ipfs).
- Updated backend to serve the static frontend build.
- Updated documentation (README, UNRAID_INSTRUCTIONS) to reflect the new architecture.
